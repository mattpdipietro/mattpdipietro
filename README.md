## Assumptions

1. **You’re good at your job.** You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t. If it feels like I’m questioning you, it’s because I’m either trying to gain context and insights, or playing devil's advocate.

1. **I’m not good at your job.** More often than not, you know better than I do. I’ll ask questions and provide context, but I won’t override you unless it's absolutely necessary.

1. **You’ll let me know if you can’t do your job.** One of my main responsibilities is ensuring that you’re set up for success. Occasionally things slip through the cracks and I won’t know I’m letting you down.

1. **You feel safe debating with me.** I find that ideas improve by being examined from all angles. To do so effectively, we must be able to have a safe debate.

1. **I might tell you what to do, but I'm not going to tell you how to do it[^1].** I will not micromanage you, but I do like to get into the details of what you are doing.

## Communication
Experience has shown me that the vast majority of issues encountered at work are the result of poor or infrequent communication. It is of extreme importance to me that we communicate well and often.

I am a product of the internet. Teams messages are always my preferred means of communication. If it's particularly urgent or complex, a quick call might work best. That said, I am an introvert, so I might not pick up if I'm not expecting the call--just give me a heads up first.

**MY DEFAULT IS TRANSPARENT** You can ask me anything. The vast majority of the time I’ll answer. Very rarely, I won’t be able to. But I’m committed to never lying to you.

## Availability

Very few things are more important than talking to you if you want to talk to me. If you need to talk, let’s talk.

**DON'T WAIT FOR THE MEETING** Heard a rumour? Need clarification on something? Blocked? Bring it to me as quickly as possible, we don’t need to wait for our next scheduled 1-on-1. As helpful as it would be, I'm not a mind reader. The reality of virtual working is it's very easy for things that are not in front of me to fly below the radar.

Feel free to put something in my calendar, don’t feel like you need to ask first (though please provide the context for meeting).

Is my calendar full? Send me a message and I’ll very likely be able to move something around.

I occasionally work a bit on the weekends. This is my choice. **I do not expect that you are going to work on the weekend.** I might send you questions or ideas, but unless I indicate otherwise due to extreme urgency, it can always wait until work begins for you on Monday.

## Feedback ##

If you are my direct report, we will have a regularly scheduled 1-on-1 meeting at least monthly. This meeting is mostly *your* time and *your* agenda. Length, frequency, format and content is up to you. We’ll start with a half hour monthly and then adjust from there.

The best 1-on-1s I’ve had have focused beyond the moment: career development, team strategy and opportunity, the bigger picture, etc. Feel free to come with a topic you’d like to discuss. I just ask that you spend a few moments ahead of time preparing so that we can use this time effectively. 

I believe accountability to your team is more meaningful than accountability to me. It’s more important that you create transparency to those affected by your results.

**Feedback should be 360&deg;** While I'm confident in my own skills and abilities, I fully understand that I have as many or more opportunities to grow and improve as anyone else. I am my harshest critic--there's no feedback you can provide me that will offend me or that will not be accounted for in my own personal development. Please, lay it on me. 

Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback:
- Safety - Unlikelihood of being punished for giving feedback. Should be high
- Effort - The amount of work in order to give feedback. Should be low
- Benefit - How likely is it that giving you feedback will materially impact your behavior? Should be high

Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions.

## North Star Principles
**Team first. Always.** Teams either succeed together, or they fail together. MVPs don't come from losing teams. 

**Failure is not an option, it's an inevitability.** I expect everyone to fail at some point. Though striving for perfection in a noble endeavor, achieving it is often impossible. What I don't find acceptable is making easily avoidable mistakes. Falling short despite strong effort and carelessness are not the same thing.

**I heavily bias towards action.** Long meetings where we are endlessly debating potential directions are often valuable, but I cannot tolerate having the same meeting and the same discussion more than once. At some point, we just need to start doing something or we'll never do anything.

**Few things are more important than continous improvement.** We should all strive to be better today than we were yesterday.

**Quality is everyone's responsibility.** Nothing to add. This one speaks for itself. 

**I start with an assumption of positive intent for all involved.** This has worked out well for me over my career. 

**I view everyone as a peer.** To be honest, I'm really not comfortable being in a position of authority. I do not care to be pandered to. Never feel the need to "sir" me--I've not been knighted...yet.

## Personality quirks

**I use metaphors. A lot.** It's better than puns. I try to keep the sports metaphors to a minimum, but they work so well for discussing team dynamics (and unfortunately, not everyone plays Dungeons and Dragons). If you do play D&D, I would love to guest as an NPC in your game. I'm a forever DM, and it's garbage.

**My default coping mechanism is sarcasm and humor.** I'd much rather laugh in the face of impending doom than cry about it. 

**I am an introvert** and that means that prolonged exposure to humans is exhausting for me. More specifically I am a textbook INTJ [^2]. 

**When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined** just ask me for both clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.

**Ask assertive versus tell assertive.** When you need to ask me to do something, just ask me. I respond incredibly well to ask assertiveness (“Matt, can you help with X?”). I respond poorly to being told what to do (“Matt, do X.”). "Because I said so" is not a valid explanation.

**I can be hyperbolic** but it’s almost always because I am excited about the topic. I also swear ~~occasionally~~ regularly. Sorry. 

## Personal life

I have a life outside of work, and I expect that you do as well. My personal life will always take precedence over work, and I believe yours should also. While I don't expect you to share all of the details of what you have going on, I hope to learn more about who you are outside of work to better understand who you are at work.

**Nothing is more important than my family** I'm married with one daughter. My wife's name is Maggie and my daughter's name is Luna. The best parts of my day are the little moments I get to walk upstairs and spend with them. They are the reason I do what I do.

**I am a cat-person** I don't just prefer cats over dogs--I'm very much like a cat. I have two exotic short hairs (smush face) named R2D2 and Fizzgig. I long to see a large cat in the wild. My patronus is a snow leopard. Dogs are man's best friends because cats know better.

**I like all the nerdy stuff** Everyone's a nerd about something. I love all the typical things (comic books, cartoons, video games, sports, tv, movies, etc.), but my biggest nerd passion is D&D and other TTRPGs--I listen to way too many real-play podcasts. I'm enthralled by the collaborative creativity of community story telling.

**This document is a [living breathing thing](https://github.com/MatthewDiPietroTR/MatthewDiPietroTR/edit/main/docs/README.md)** and likely incomplete. It's new, and I plan to update it frequently. I'd love your feedback.

[^1]: There are two exceptions to this rule. 1) I've been told I have to tell you how to do it and I've lost that argument or 2) the team has not taken responsibility for determining a course of action in a timely, efficient manner. In case of the second scenario, feel free to propose an alternative approach provided the outcomes are the same. 
[^2]: Though not an exact science, I think Meyers-Briggs and other similar personality tests are a good way to gain insights into the baseline behaviors and personalities of individuals. In my case, the [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) profile provided at 16personalities.com reads like a high-level biography as humorously confirmed by both my mother and my wife.
